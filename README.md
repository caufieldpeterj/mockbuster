# Mockbuster
 Time is an extremely important competitive priority for Mockbuster, especially regarding our customers. That is why with our NEW "Total Access" Plan, subscribers will have even more options for their digital rentals like expirations via keys so waiting for things to disappear is a thing of the past. 
 
 ## Mission Statement
 
 ```
 Become the global leader in rentable home entertainment
 ```
 
 ## Usage
 
 - User Sign's up using provided links
 - Once user has been verified, they are taken to their custom watchlist
 - User Watchlist: "Your personal inventory of Video entertainment programs to reserve until you are ready to view them with your favorite snacks!!"
 - Once satisfied or unsatisfied, the user has the option to remove the program from their custom inventory by utilizing a removal button.
 - "Total Access" Plan uses a strategy designed with specific keys that will allow the user to set temporary reserves of programs if the account is shared.
 - Potential users can be provided with a free trial of Mockbuster Online (receiviing a free movie rental at the time they agree), or given an informational readMe file. 
 - Users will have their accounts billed every 30-days with 0 late fees. 
 - CANCEL when you want too: 30 days of bespoke video entertainment is at your fingertips!!
